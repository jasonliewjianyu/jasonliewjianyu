I am a recent graduate of Bell's 6-month cyber security course, with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems. I am capable of handling high-stress environments and love the nature of solving problems in this ever-changing world. 

## Objective

My experience as an equities trading professional and former EOD team leader has ignited my passion for cybersecurity. I am now eager to transition into this field and am aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst or a similar role.
